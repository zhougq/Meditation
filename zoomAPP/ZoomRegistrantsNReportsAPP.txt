This is a step by step instructions document of how to use the ZoomRegistrants app to add multiple registrants information into Zoom meeting. In case of webinar, some update of the code is necessary.  

Zoom register app
1. Set up a python code editing and running environment on your computer. I'm using a simple one: IDLE with python3.6.8, which is pretty old version. You can choose your favorite IDE with higher python version.
2. There is a configure file that should be saved in the same folder of the app. The app related information will be saved in this configure file. Each time before a new task of adding registrants into a meeting, you need to update this configure file.
3. Log in Zoom and go to https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting#/upcoming, update the "meeting_id" field of configure file with the meeting id you find here.
4. Save the registrants excel file in some folder. Then based on the folder name, file name and its relative location of the app, update the configure file: configure_file.json of "working_folder","registrants_file", 
eg: I save my excel file "2024_01_JOL2calss_attendance_1.xlsx" under the folder "VolunteerWorkJOL2Jan262024", and this folder's relative location compared with my app's folder is "../", then "working_folder" gets the value "../VolunteerWorkJOL2Jan262024/", "registrants_file" gets "2024_01_JOL2calss_attendance_2.xlsx". Be careful do NOT hide any rows in the excel file, which will lead to unexpected errors.
Note: MAC generated excel file from a number file has some format issue and will cause the reading of a column fail.
5. Log in zoom, go to page https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting#/upcoming, find out the meeting you are working on and click it, in this case it is "德噶明觉JOL2网课2024-01", then on the table click "Registration", click "Edit" of "Manage Registrants", here shows all the pending, approved, denied registrants.
6. Run the app, and check in Zoom if the registrants have been approved. If you want to do a test you can try to read the code and modify it. I have written some other functions to test, approve, or delete a registrant.  
7. Some incorrect data in the excel file will lead to exception exit. For example: "Data request" as an email will cause app failure. 
8. In case of duplicated email address, Zoom will add only ONE registrant data. 
9. When the local PC is loaded with apps and has little resource to run the registration app, the http connection might be shut down by the zoom server, causing "connection disconnected by the peer" error. So restart the PC before running the app.

Participants report app
1. Update "check_column" field in the configure file based on the column in the registration file we want to check as first time student . In our case we check whether a participant is a first time student in the excel file "2024_01_JOL2calss_attendance_1.xlsx" column Q.
2. The "working_folder", "registrants_file" fields are the same as register app. Noted that the app will update the registrants file, it is recommended to make a copy of the original file before running the app.
3. Log in zoom, go to page https://us02web.zoom.us/account/my/report#/ , it shows a table of meetings information.
4. Find out the meeting you want to do the report and click on the number on the "Participants" column, on the pop-up window, click "Show unique users" then click "Export" button, a .csv file will be generated by Zoom, download and save the file in the same working folder, then update the configure file "participants_report_file" with this file name.
5. Run the app，check the registrants file to see the result: a report column with the meeting date is added, if a student does not show up, in the column it will get "no show". If a student's duration is 50 minutes less than the total duration, then in the column it gets "leave early(x)", in which x is the student's duration.
